Best movies I saw in 2021, not necessarily published in this year, ranked from the least favorite (which still means I liked it a lot, all those I gave a score of 9/10 on my movie database, except the number 1 which is a 10/10). Some honorable mentions listed after.

## 10 

### [The Kid Detective](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8980602/)

A debut writer director comes up with a dark/dry comedy noir with an actually good mystery, great humor, amazing editing and perfect acting, especially from Adam Brody. The movie is full of self-contemplation of the main character that is delivered in a nice, indirect way (they don't spell it out, they show you who he is and why) and intaglent with the story perfectly. This movie is certainly not for all, because of its specific humor, but even if you don’t like that aspect of it, both the story, the mystery and how they unfold is still very interesting. Brody’s character incompetence and eventual development in this “coming of age” story with a twist on the trope, drive this noir crime piece with a firm hand that is rarely seen on a director/writer with no previous feature experience. Certainly a filmmaker to keep track of.

## 9

### [The Clovehitch Killer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6269368/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

Once again a director with his first feature, only making shorts or “fan-made” movies before. The movie has a setting and a story, so scarily easy to feel attached to, mostly due to great Dylan McDermontt performance of an everyday suburban dad, that feels just like your typical dad, that if you had a normal, good father (or are one), you can relate to. Once again a coming of age story, but in a disturbing setting, where a boy has to become a man taking on his father's responsibilities to protect the rest of his family from the father itself, hiding a dark secret. The story is simple, yet told in a very interesting way, due to how compelling the movie is visually. No shot is wasted, it either helps to tell the story, or emotions, or conveys something about the characters, creates a setup or delivers a payoff. Everything works, and clicks in this movie, that handles its tone with great mastery.

## 8

### [Relic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9072352/)

A third movie on this list coming from a first time feature director, this time a woman, which can be felt throughout the movie, with just three female characters (one male officer shows up to deliver a few lines at the start of the movie, the rest is just three characters in one place). There are many things to praise in this horror piece, including how scary it can be. Sure you won’t jump in your seat because of a cheap jump-scare connected to pointless loud sound, it might not send shivers down your spine when a spooky monster comes up. It will scare you though, cause it will stay with you. The movie tells a story of dementia, and how it affects not only the person afflicted with it, but also people close to them. If you had encountered that in your life, you know how devastating this can be, and the movie shows great taste in showing that, and using it to deliver horror. This is greatly used by shooting the movie in one place that we get to know, and see every aspect of it, the beauty and the disturbing parts of it, paying off in the horror finale that has a great but non “hit you over the head” meaning. Although the movie is indeed scary and stays with you because of those moments, it survives mostly thanks to its great, thought provoking and emotionally rich ending. Great acting of all three actresses also does a great deal in helping you feel for all the characters.

### [Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/?ref_%3Dref_ext_justwatch)

As a big fan of the book and the entire series (as in written by Frank Herber, and not his son who is trying to rape his fathers legacy) I anticipated this greatly, especially being familiar and deeply in admarition of Denis Villeneuve previous work. He created undoubtedly best science-fiction movies of the 2010’s decade with *Arrival* and *Blade Runner 2049*. The movie was not a disappointment, as it followed the books closely, but not mindlessly, adding its own creative works into it. I loved the brutalism architecture and vehicular design, the detailed costumes and visual style knowing  what and how to show the world the action takes place in. The music built an atmosphere and conveyed what kind of universe you are taking a glimpse into, a foreign and dangerous one. The casting was great, although changes in Duncan Idaho character played by Jason Momoa were not exactly to my liking, and in my opinion, the tone of the character did become a dent in the overall tone of the movie. However the rest of the casting (besides the gender-bender of lietKynes) stuck in my mind so deeply that when I think of the book characters I cannot imagine them any different than I saw them in the movie. And don’t get me wrong Sharon Duncan-Brewster actually did a great job in her role, the gender swap did not actually play any role, but thinking about the book I can’t imagine a woman as a male character. I put this movie maybe a bit higher than I should because of personal connection to the source material, but I do believe that with the second part it will be a science-fiction masterpiece. I was so thrilled to actually see a big budget production that was entirely entrusted to someone with great talent, skill and passion for the project and I was even happier to see it succeed. I just hope that Dune becoming famous again will not result in deconstruction of the source material for pure profit as Hollywood tried doing with the David Lynch version that they tried to rape and then sell as Star Wars, including producing toys of Baron Harkonnen, and cat interlinked with a rat to produce an anti-toxin made of their milk. Anyway…

### [Bone Tomahawk](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2494362/)

Justified graphic, extremely bloody and brutal violence on the screen is something a movie usually has to work very hard to, or it becomes just mindless (yet possibly fun) gore fest. I don’t mind gore, is it tasteful or not it can be fun and I like me some slasher movies. But brutal violence can be used as a great tool in storytelling and filmmaking alike. There is quite some violence and gore in Bone Tomahawk, but the movie is most definitely not built just to show that. Gore is simply the result of the world the movie takes places in, a world that is very real, and raw but still very believable and exciting to watch action take place in. 
The story is simple, characters don’t really have very complicated background but they don’t have to have it. They are very well acted and their personalities are well thought-out. They all get good arcs and the way their stories end sticks with you for a long time.
S. Craig Zahler has had a great movie debut, being a renowned comic book creator and also a little bit of a musician. He has followed up Bone Tomahawk with two other movies. One of them also ended up in my honorable mentions and I can’t wait to finally get a hold of the other one, cause in Bone Tomahawk he showed a deep understanding of what makes a movie engaging, exciting, he knows how to build and guide characters and how to structure a story. With a talent and skill like this it is no wonder that he collected such a good cast for his first movie. Everyone in that movie was absolutely terrific, and they ended up making the best western of the decade it came out if I am being honest. It is by no means a traditional western, it shares the setting for sure, but not the climate, atmosphere and themes.
Watch this please.

### [State of Play](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473705/)

Kevin Macdonald is a director I had very mixed feelings about before watching this movie. He has made mostly documentaries, or features that act closely to documentaries. I really loved **The Last King of Scotland**, a movie that I watched rather young and had a great effect on me. But I also watched **The Eagle** and was very disappointed, largely due to being very interested in the history of ancient Rome, but mostly due to the movie being just dull, and not that well acted.
So with two polarizing movies I approached **State of Play** with no real expectations and got greeted by one of the best thrillers I saw. Its pace is perfect, mystery interesting and twists engaging and not cheap. All this topped with the best Russell Crowe performance I saw and I saw every one of his major movies. Everything comes in together like in a masterfully crafted clock. Two hours fly by so fast thanks to how well structured and directed this movie is, the script is used to near perfection, every line delivered has meaning and a purpose. Just a masterfully made movie that deserves your time and attention.

### [Apocalypto](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472043/)

I have been waiting to see this movie for a long time. I really like Mel Gibson, enjoyed everything I have seen him in, and seeing Gringo for the first time in the cinema, being his “return” movie after being recorded drunk, filled me with a lot of nostalgia for his Lethal Weapon movies which I saw so many, many times. However he has impressed me with a director with every other movie I saw from him, Apocalypto being the only one I missed. This was because I really enjoyed aesthetics, exploration of ancient/bronze age southern american civilizations like mayans etc. The movie delivers on it heavily, and since release has received tons of praise. Some criticism was directed towards it too, which I thought was just stupid. Main points delivered against the movie were against its ending and the brutal depiction of the aspects of cultures depicted. Apparently some thought it was supposed to be offensive towards those cultures and the ending promoted christian values. To arrive at those conclusions you have to watch all the Transformers movies beforehand in one sitting to completely shut off your brain. Some historical alterations were also made in favor of filmmaking values, visual appeal and story coherence, but those were all made with consulting from indigenious people, who still preserve the history and at least some of the culture of basically eradicated mayans.
To focus on the movie itself though - attention to detail and underlying themes of race, imperialism are weaved in amazingly with a simple story of wanting to take care of your family at all cost. It culminates with an amazing, long action-chase scene that feels natural, raw and as real as possible to the point where they filmed the protagonist running from a panther with a real animal. Using native language helps the authenticity of the movie and it's a shame that more filmmakers are not as dedicated to their work as Mel Gibson to enforce this care about the material they are creating, especially when dealing with historical elements.

![Apocalypto](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.tmdb.org%2Ft%2Fp%2Foriginal%2FnnmbJvYyDS1VkMOCbxSpdBi3WbJ.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)
*The posters for the movie were also something else. Oozing with atmosphere*

Apocalypto also looks great. I watched it early this year, and when I think back on it, I can remember so many images, scenes, and singular shots. Dean Semler, cinematographer for Apocalypto has received a lot of praise for this and it is well deserved. Same goes for editing of the movie, specially for action scenes, as I mentioned, they are simply terrific. It was most definitely not easy to shoot them in the conditions they made for themselves, but the editing takes no compromises, showing you what is going on, just the way it is, brutal, bloody, violent and sudden, but also completely natural.
It's a shame Mel Gibson does not direct that much, but when he does, he always does a great job. Also a shame he had to become persona non-grata for some time, who knows what projects we missed during his break? Nevertheless I am glad he came back, and has done some great work since then.

### [Silverado](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090022/)

Silverado took me by surprise. Director of it is a sort of legendary screenplay writer, but at that time he had little credits as a director. One day though the movie came up on streaming, I saw a great cast, and got interested in what Kasdan could have picked up from working with Spielberg, especially when working with such a cast.
The result was one of the best westerns I saw. It is far more classic western than Bone Tomahawk, and both movies are what they are by design. Silverado is first and foremost fun. It starts out exciting and remains entertaining on the highest level till the very end and long after credits end. The characters stay with you cause they are all not just quirks, they are real characters, introduced in interesting ways, given nice arcs and played professionally by craftsmen of their workline as actors. 
What Kasden knows and any other good filmmaker is that action will never be exciting, even when the stunts are dangerous, explosions big and crashed cars expensive, if you do not care about the characters involved in those stunts, explosions and chases. That is why every story beat in the movie has an effect on either all, or a particular character.
The screenplay (by Kasden brothers) is well thought out, and a great example of most good screenplay tropes. The setups and payoffs are planted perfectly, the dialog is sharp and truthful, humor moments are well times, different tones the movie goes into are handled with care, the finale is satisfying.
This movie is a perfect example of why cliches are a thing, cause yes the movie has a few of them. Cliches become what they are, which is basically a thing considered to be the expected standard, because when they are used and made by someone who understands why cliche became a cliche, they just work. Everything in this movie works, cliche or not, you don’t mind, because everything does its job.

### [Twilight Samurai](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351817/)

I am a sucker for jidaigeki movies. I won't lie. To be perfectly clear - those are some of the movies that got me interested in actual filmmaking art, not just watching movies. When I first watched **Seven Samurai** I wasn’t just interested in samurai and all the culturals, humane aspects this movie depicted. I was fascinated by how the people who made it made me feel the way I felt, using such a simple story and making their movie quite some time ago. Surely by now others would have figured it out, and perfected it? But at that time I have not seen a single movie that could rival Kurosawa's masterpiece. Apparently many people studied it, but failed to replicate the same results. Obviously at the time I was rather young and oblivious to many other masters of art of filmmaking that in time I have discovered but until watching Twilight Samurai for the first time I have experienced the same feeling when I watched Seven Samurai for the first time, very few times. I still can’t place my finger on what it is exactly in “samurai” movies that makes them speak to me the way they are, especially those who leverage the line between samurai legends and myths, and actually deconstructing them. It takes great sensitivity and intelligence to do it the way Kurosawa did it, but Yoji Yamada was up for the task. The movie could have come out forty years ago. It fits so well into the way Japan made their jidaigeki movies, down to having really great posters in a minimalistic style, which movies like this sometimes utilized, when not resorting to copying Hollywood posters, full of faces of actors included.

*Beautiful*

It's one of the few movies that has made me cry. It has heart as not too many others. It has class and it has much love put into it. It looks, sounds and is a masterpiece of its own class, belonging with the best there is in the genre, by all means. Hiroyuki Sanada has received a lto of recognition for this role, and even made a breakthrough in American cinema later thanks to Twilight Samurai and good for him, he deserved all the success for putting a performance as real and true to the character as he did. Everyone was great and I say this knowing its a cliche, but the movie deserved all the praise it could get, and saying a general compliment may not seem like enough, but the movie is glowing with attention to detail that has to be seen to be appreciated. So if you haven’t, do it. It is a work of art, it's one of the very best pieces of art that cinema has to offer.

### [The Nightingale](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4068576/)

The 10/10 movie of the year. Seems weird that I have given movies like Twilight Samurai or Apocalypto such high praise but haven’t referred to them as such “perfect” movies that The Nightingale is in my opinion. To be honest in terms of my recipement of all the movies on this list, they are all of rather similar quality, but Jennifer’s Kent second feature takes the cake and I feel like I didn't really have to consider which movie I liked the best of the list.
In the end it was the one where I could not take my eyes away from the screen even for a second even if I hated what was depicted. The movie takes a grip on you early on, warying in moments of beauty and violence like no other. Cause yes, it is brutal and has uncut, almost unedited scenes of rape, but it is historicaly accurate to Van Diemen's Land and it has a strong affect on you, the story and the characters. It is important however to look past the depiction and focus on the effects of the acts themselves, and how the movie handles it all.
Jennifer Kent is from Tasmania herself apparently, and you can see that it has to be in a way a passion project, something she wanted to do and show. After the success of Babadook, she was offered many jobs by Hollywood, including the Wonder Woman seat of director. She rejected it all to make a movie, where the same woman gets raped twice, and she can’t even kill the people who did it? And many, many other horrible things happen along the way to her? How could this be a passion project?
I must admit, I consider the strongest part of the movie its story, the way it's told by filmmaking and acting, scenography etc. is obviously masterful and important to core of the story itself, but in itself, it's such a strong, gripping, meaningful tale that not a day goes by since I saw it, that it does not cross my mind.
Yes it is brutal, but not just for the sake of showing how awful colonialism was, how shitty was British treatment of Tasmania, although historical accuracy does do a lot for the movie. It is brutal because it helps you find a footing in the world depicted, to understand it and to know what to expect. But then you are wrong, because it shows you that the world is not how you might think it is, and even if it sometimes is, or appears to be, you do not have to agree to it, go to compromise or go along with it. You can still find beauty, meaning, maybe even joy in the face of great peril, pain. The movie story and the way it's shown, filmed, tell a lot of things, but it never forces them down your throat, it is never artsy or artificial. Everything that is achieved is earned. It is not an art-house movie, telling a brutal story from the perspective of an art school student behind the camera in a studio or mansion, who has never experienced hardship but tries to preach to you about the values of life. It is an honest film that respects you, its characters, no matter who they are, and treats them how life treats them. Not fairly or unfairly, not justly or unjustly. It just treats them like people, and it's them who create the world we're thrown into in The Nightingale, the best movie I saw in 2021.


## Honorable mentions

### [Dragged Across Concrete](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6491178/)

Latest movie from the director/writer of Bone Tomahawk, but this time with Mel Gibson in the cast. Maybe even better than Bone Tomahawk. Hope that Zahler keeps making movies and brings in more old but capable actors like Gibson or Russell, cause they still know very well how to do their job, better than most nowadays.

### [The Exorcist III](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099528/)

This movie is very overlooked. Maybe cause Exorcist II was a joke, with no involvement from original creators. Well William Petter Blatty maybe got pissed by Exorcist II and wanted to show them how it is done. The movie features a legendary horror scene, maybe the best role from George C. Scott (who was IMHO a GOAT) and some other great acting. Amazing confrontation scenes, smart script and surprisingly great direction from a writer that maybe learned a lot from Friedkin on the set of The Exorcist.

### [Hardcore](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079271/)

Another great George C. Scott performance. A very reflective movie, with its hearth at simple dialog scenes, where two world views (or just two worlds) collide and try to understand each other. Ending is a bit of a waste, but the rest of the movie is a great insightful and respectful look into two worldviews where you probably fall somewhere into the middle, giving you a great time contemplating your own thoughts about matters depicted.

### [The Tale of Two Sisters (2003)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365376/?ref_=tt_urv)

Not the first version of this story, but truth be told, possibly the best. The director of this movie has a great track record with his later movies, but he showed great skill and understanding of horror with his early work already.

### [13 Assassins (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1436045/)

Takashi Miike samurai movie. If you know his other movies this should be enough of a promotion. He never failed me, and this time was no different. Great story, and amazing, just amazing end battle sequence.

### [Samurai III: Deual at Ganryu Island](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049710/)

Great end of a trilogy of movies that have maintained a great level of quality through all three entries. Mifune was so natural in this role, no matter what stage of the character arc he was in.

### [Drag Me to Hell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127180/)

Sam Raimi movie I missed and I glad I did, cause I think watching it now, I appreciated it more than I would ever before. He truly is a master of his own class and his style is impossible to copy, none does what he does the way he does it.
